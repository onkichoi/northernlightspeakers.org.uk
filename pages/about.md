**About**
We are a dynamic and friendly public speaking club in North London affiliated with Toastmasters International. We are open to all, from the absolute beginner to the experienced speaker. Some of us are preparing to give a knockout wedding speech, others to become an inspirational leader or nail a job interview.

**History**

Northern Lights Speakers Club

Northern Lights Speakers Club (so called because of North London location, because we encourage all our members to ‘sparkle,’ and because our inaugural president Carin Schwartz was from Sweden, home of the Northern Lights).

Carin and Kate McNeilly started the club in 2004.

**What we do**
When you join our club you will follow Toastmasters’ learning programme ‘Pathways’ where you have the option to pick the skills you want to focus on as part of your development. You will practice both impromptu speaking and prepared speeches covering topics such as speech organisation, vocal variety, language, gestures, and persuasion.

**With Northern Lights you will:**
• Gain communication and leadership skills (e.g. deliver your message with presence and impact; build confidence and self-awareness, give and receive constructive feedback, practice writing speeches and presentations, overcome your fear of public speaking)
• Gain a competitive edge in your life and career
• Make new friends. And more!
  
**Our club mission**
We believe that regular practice makes perfect. It is only by showing up, and standing up, that you will become a more present and impactful communicator. We support and challenge each other to become better speakers and achieve our goals.
Why join us?
Presentation courses can be great. But they can also be a ‘flash in the pan’ event that is never followed up and therefore not retained in your ‘muscle memory’. By showing up time after time you will become a more confident speaker and leader. You will learn new things about yourself and about your fellow speakers. You will learn to give useful and structured feedback -- an essential life skill. We are a supportive, inquisitive and ambitious group who are on a journey to learn and develop. Come and join us! 


**Toastmaster international**

Toastmasters International has been in existence since 1924 and contrary to a once widely held belief, the organisation is about a whole lot more than the archetypal image of ‘The Toastmaster’ in his red jacket and immaculate starched shirt calling his audience to order at functions.

Toastmasters is about becoming a competent communicator, at all levels, in large groups or small. Clear, confident oral communication is very persuasive.


**Toastmasters programme**

In Toastmasters, members learn by following an online facility which guides you on your chosen ‘Pathway’ ie, the one which suits what you are looking for, with notes, videos and projects to conduct Club meetings. 

Club meetings enable you to demonstrate your project and practice communication and leadership skills by taking on roles at the meeting, you develop through your projects and also through Club roles.

With fellow members who also are there for the same reason you are in a supportive environment.  If you need help to get started then you can choose to work with a mentor; someone who probably started out just as uncertain as you may be feeling right now.

**About**

Northern Lights Speakers Club, founded in 2004, is named for our North London roots, our mission to help members sparkle and shine, and our first president, Carin Schwart was from Sweden, the homeland of the northern lights.

We are a dynamic and friendly public speaking club in North London affiliated with Toastmasters International. We are open to all, from the absolute beginner to the experienced speaker. Some of us are preparing to give a knockout wedding speech, others to become an inspirational leader or nail a job interview.


**What we do**

We believe that consistent practice is key. By showing up and speaking regularly, you will grow into a more confident, impactful communicator. Our club offers a supportive yet challenging environment where we help each other improve and reach our goals.

When you join our club, you will follow Toastmasters’ _Pathways_ programme, and:

• Gain communication and leadership skills (e.g. deliver your message with presence and impact; build confidence and self-awareness, give and receive constructive feedback, practice both impromptu and prepared speeches ocusing on areas like structure, vocal variety, language, gestures, and persuasion, overcome your fear of public speaking)

• Gain a competitive edge in your life and career

• Make new friends, and more. Join us on the journey!

**What is Toastmasters?**

Toastmasters International, founded in 1924, is a global organisation dedicated to helping people become confident, effective communicators and leaders. It is far more than the old image of a formal toastmaster in a red jacket—it’s about developing real-world speaking and leadership skills in a supportive environment.

Through the _Pathways_ learning programme, members choose a development path tailored to their goals, supported by online resources, videos, and practical projects. At club meetings, you will put these skills into action—delivering speeches, taking on leadership roles, and giving and receiving structured feedback.

Everyone is here to grow, and you are never alone. Mentors are available to guide you as you begin your journey.

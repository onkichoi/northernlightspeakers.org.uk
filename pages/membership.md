You're  welcome to attend our club meetings as a guest—free of charge—to see if we are the right fit for you. You can visit as many times as you like, but to access the full benefits of Toastmasters, you will need to become a member.

## **Joining us**

Once you decide to join, you can do so by following these steps: 

1. Email the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/membershipform">joining form</a> to nlspeakers@gmail.com
2. Upon receiving the form, we will email you our bank details, for you to pay one of the amounts (6 or 12 months, see below) by bank transfer. 

### **New member**

6 Months: £116 

12 Months: £200 

_Included in the fee is a contribution of £20 for new joiners. This enables Toastmasters International to register you and access the online resources.
You won’t need to pay this again (unless your membership lapses and you re-join)._

### **Or, if you are an existing member**

6 Months: £96

12 Months: £180

##### <br/> How your membership fees contribute:

- Venue hire (Oak and Pastor Function Room)
- Toastmasters International fees
- Equipment storage
- Social media subscriptions (e.g. Meetup)
- Occasional guest speakers

*Northern Lights doesn’t make a profit from membership dues, everything goes back into running the club.*

If you're eager to progress quickly through the Toastmasters programme, we strongly recommend working with a Mentor.

A Mentor is a trusted advisor—someone who can help you navigate the early challenges of public speaking and guide you on your journey toward becoming a confident communicator.

At Toastmasters, a Mentor is someone who understands what it takes to grow as a speaker because they have been through it themselves. They will offer support, encouragement, and practical advice to help you improve. Even seasoned speakers benefit from Mentorship, as there’s always more to learn and refine.

Mentorship is a two-way relationship. Once you're paired with a Mentor, it's also your responsibility to make sure the relationship is effective. You'll typically agree on how and when to meet—this could be in person, over the phone, or by email.

Before delivering a speech, you may want to rehearse with your Mentor. Ideally, this should be in a private space where you can move around, practice gestures, and experiment with your voice.

At Northern Lights Speakers, we have several experienced members who are happy to serve as Mentors. Mentoring is a rewarding experience for both the mentor and the mentee.

To learn more or to be paired with a Mentor, please speak to the VP Membership or the VP Education.

To organise our meetings and keep a record of our club database we use a programme called **easySPEAK** which has been made available to us and many other clubs, free of charge.

All members have access to **easySPEAK**, via **toastmasterclub.org**. Book your speech slots, sign up for roles - this really helps our VPE!

Using **EASYSPEAK** you can also generally keep in touch with whatâ€™s going on, and track your individual progress all on the site!

1. When you become a member, a username and a password will be set up for you. You can change this yourself the first time you visit the site.

2. Remember, the more willing you are to become involved in Northern Lights Speakers Club and the worldwide organisation, the faster you will progress your own learning and development.

3. Finally, take some time to visit the international site [**www.toastmasters.org**](http://www.toastmasters.org/) where you will find a huge range of educational materials on offer and more information about this organisation founded in 1924.

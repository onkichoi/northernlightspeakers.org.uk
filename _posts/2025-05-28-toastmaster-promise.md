There is more involved in joining Toastmasters than simply showing up regularly at meetings to progress your own journey through the training. 

There are a host of leadership opportunities available at Club, Area, and Division levels. The journey begins with the promise you make, not just to your club or the organisation, but firstly, to yourself.

**As a member of Toastmasters International and my club, I promise:**

- To attend club meetings regularly
- To prepare all of my speech and leadership projects to the best of my ability
- To prepare for and fulfil meeting assignments
- To provide fellow members with helpful, constructive evaluations
- To help the club maintain the positive, friendly environment necessary for all members to learn and grow
- To serve my club as an officer when called upon to do so
- To treat my fellow club members and our guests with respect and courtesy
- To bring guests to club meetings so they can see the benefits being a member of Toastmasters offers
- To adhere to the guidelines and rules for all Toastmasters education and recognition programs
- To maintain honest and highly ethical standards during the conduct of all Toastmasters activities
